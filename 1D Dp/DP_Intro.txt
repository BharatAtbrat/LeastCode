Dp is a way to reduce the complexity of your recursive solution to a code

It is a concept not an algorithmn
It merely aims to reduce the complexity of recursive code 


Step 1:  is to always always find a brute force recursive solution to your problem then code it up my guy
Step 2: Then optimize lmaoo, break the problem into subproblems, either start from the beginning'
            (top down) or from the end (bottom up)
Step 3: try storing repeating values draw tree youll understand and then code it up
